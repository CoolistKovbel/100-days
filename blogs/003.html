      Alrighty so basically woke up about 15 min ago, going to basically start my whole day soon. Going to try to code for atleast 1 hour and 30 min instead of 2 hours. Just so I can focus harder. Might create a trade. Going go for a least 1 trade a day. As well as try to make sure I get my youtube videos setup.

        Alrighty so basically got the jist about mapping and structs. As well as using inheritence between smart contracts.
        Still contemplating on which would be better to loop over. IF putting a struct in a mapping with a certain key better than turning a whole struct into an array. But I do want to better understand between how I would be able to return a certain struct through a function.
