    <h2>Notes: </h2>
    <p>
      Well today woke up a little bit earlier so that is good, about to drink some eggs and eat something sweet to get my brain going. At the same time drinking a bottle of water so i am not so dehydrated and ready to learn. Might do my 25 pushups earlier today but we shall see. Going to be contining with my solidity course, might end up coding today if i am lucky but we shall see. Going to follow it up with my javascript course. I forget to mention I am going to need to really also work on the 30 day solidity challange as well as youtube videos and shopify store. I know this is only my second day but I need to step my game up just a little bit. Cant be lacking.

      So far its okay feeling  a little bit tired. feel like I am going to need a little more practice with solidity going to be using the cryptozombies website to practice my skills and hopefully finish it this time. At the same time feeling eh. A little bit eh cause of solidity but gotta feel more confident

        Well today i learn a litte bit about the type of tools i would need to use. I have been using remix a lot. At the same time started learn about the syntax about solidity. Feel like I preety much understand the basic of the syntax it is preety similar to javascript. But going to need to make sure i can sharpen my skills and get into the style of programming.
